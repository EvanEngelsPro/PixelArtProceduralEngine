# PixelArtProceduralEngine
An engine capable of automatically generating pixel art sprites (characters, monsters, objects, backgrounds) from customizable parameters. The user defines constraints (shapes, palettes, silhouettes, visual styles), and the engine instantly produces different variations that can be used in 2D games.
