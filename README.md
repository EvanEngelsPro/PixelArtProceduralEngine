#PixelArtProceduralEngine

PixelArtProceduralEngine is now a web-based image to pixel art editor.

Instead of automatically generating procedural sprites, the project has evolved into a manual pixelation tool that lets users transform any image into pixel art with full control over the result.

✨ Features

🔲 Adjustable pixelation level (resolution reduction with a slider)

🌗 Brightness control

🎚️ Contrast adjustment

🎨 Saturation adjustment

⚡ Real-time preview directly in the browser

💾 Export the final pixel art image

🎯 Goal

Provide a simple and intuitive tool for:

creating retro / pixel art styles

preparing sprites or textures for 2D games

experimenting with different visual looks manually

The focus is on user control rather than procedural generation.
